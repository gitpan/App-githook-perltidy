* Do everything post-commit:
    - done with a "commit --amend"
    - much less mucking about with saving state - simpler
    - doesn't interrupt the flow as much (commit message can be edited
      stright away)
    - still have the problem with partial commits? divergence?
    - Or possibly consider doing with git filters

* "make test" on renames?

* Investigate use of git attribute filters

* Re-add files which are newly added "A" status when doing partial
commit?

* Fix git version problem?

* Check and restore .git/MERGE_HEAD if it exists

* Check that current branch is not (no branch)

* "amend" screws with the reset stuff

Check Makefile vs Makefile.PL modification times for re-run.

Also tidy up on renames, as they show up only as renames even if the
file got modified as well.

* Detect modified .perltidyrc or .podtidy-opts files and error out
