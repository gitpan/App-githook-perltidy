Perltidy the stash contents before attempting to pop them?? This would
solve a bunch of conflict errors

Do a git checkout in another directory and run the make test from
there.

Check Makefile vs Makefile.PL modification times for re-run.

Also tidy up on renames, as they show up only as renames even if the
file got modified as well.

Clean the index when popping the stack after a (successful?) commit

Warn if a perltidy on *everything* would result in a dirty stash apply
after the commit.
